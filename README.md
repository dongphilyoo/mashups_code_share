code snippet of face detection javascript library with p5.js

### FYI
Sharing this untidy code for ITP Mashups 2018 Spring class.
I used a javascript face detection library called [clmtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr), and integrated it in p5.js environment. I hope you get a basic idea that how to utilize face detection library along with p5.js.
